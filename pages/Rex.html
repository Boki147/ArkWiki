        <p>Wild</p>
        <p>Arguably the deadliest creature on the Island, <i>Tyrannosaurus dominum</i> is a killing machine. 
            Active mostly when hunting for food or defending its nest, a good plan is to avoid every Tyrannosaurus.

            It is pure power from its stomp to its tail. It is not able to intimidate every foe with its roar, but upon hearing it, 
            it might scare the poop out of you quite literally.

            Despite being a different sub-species of Tyrannosaurus, everyone I've met still refers to them as a "Rex" or a "T-Rex". 
            I've long since stopped trying to convince anyone, especially the few who I've encountered wearing Tyrannosaurus teeth 
            as necklaces.</p>
            <p>Domesticated</p>
        <p>Taming a Tyrannosaurus is without a doubt the goal for any warlord or warring tribe. 
            Tyrannosaurus is a fierce battle companion. There is a reason Tyrannosaurus is considered the 
            king of dinosaurs (or in this genus, the "lord"). Any tribe that manages to tame one has almost nothing to fear.

    <h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
    <p>Highly aggressive, Tyrannosaurus will attack most living creatures in sight aside from other apex predators. 
        They're extremely bulky, having nearly double the  Health of  Spino of the same level. They also possess surprisingly good  
        Stamina for their size, of which is also greater than that of any same-leveled  Spino. What Tyrannosauruses lack in attacking speed 
        (when compared to a  Spinosaurus) they make up for in sheer  Health. Tyrannosaurus generally ignore mounted tamed animals and choose 
        to attack wild animals instead, but will attack tamed mounted animals if they get too close. 
        However if they see a helpless tame or dismounted  Human in the open, they will begin to attack.</p>

    <h2 id="taming">Taming</h2>
    <p>Taming a Rex requires careful preparation. Survivors should bring plenty of tranquilizing tools, such as Tranq Arrows or Darts, 
        and a significant amount of food, preferably Prime Meat or Kibble. Building a trap is highly recommended to ensure a safer taming 
        process.</p>

    <h2 id="uses">Uses</h2>
    <p>The Rex is one of the best combat mounts in the game. Its high health, massive damage output, and ability to roar and intimidate 
        smaller creatures make it invaluable for boss fights and PvP encounters. Additionally, its roar can cause certain creatures to flee, 
        providing a strategic advantage.</p>
